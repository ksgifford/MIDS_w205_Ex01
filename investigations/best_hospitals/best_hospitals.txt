To determine which hospitals provided the highest quality of care, I evaluated
both the average quality rating across the various procedures and how consistently
each hospital achieved their average level of quality. To do this, I synthesized
and overall Quality Score for each hospital. The Quality Score for each hospital
is a combination of the following:

1.  Average Procedure Rating
    As part of data transformation, the Score presented in the raw procedure data
    was standardized to present the percentage of cases that received the correct
    treatment for the associated condition (per the description in the data dictionary).
    The Timely and Effective Care - Hospital and Readmission and Death - Hospital
    datasets were combined to evaluate a broad spectrum of procedures and conditions.
    Procedures where a positive outcome was indicated by a low Score were transformed
    to be consistent, including several fro the Timely and Effective Care dataset,
    as well as all procedures from the Readmission and Death dataset.
    The dataset included some procedures that were not consistent with the percentage
    scoring metric, measuring median times or emergency department volumes. These
    measures were excluded from analysis to maintain a consistent set of metrics.
    After transformation, procedure scores were averaged for each hospital.

2.  Procedure Score Variability
    Variability was measured by calculating the standard deviation of the collection
    of procedure scores for each hospital. Hospitals with a lower standard deviation
    have more consistent procedure scores, and hospitals with a higher standard
    deviation have less consistent scores.
    Procedures for which no scores were available were evaluated as a score of zero.
    This was done to account for hospitals with very high scores for a small number
    of procedures but no scores recorded in most. For example, a hospital that scored
    100% for two procedures, but had no scores for 20 others could potentially have
    a very high quality score (high average and low variability), even though there
    is actually very little data on which to judge its performance.

The Quality Score for each hospital was calculated as:
Quality Score = Average Procedure Score / (Standard Deviation of Scores / Average of All Hospital Standard Deviations)

The table below lists the hospitals with the top ten Quality Scores. These hospitals
displayed consistently high scores across a variety of metrics, making them models
of high quality care.
