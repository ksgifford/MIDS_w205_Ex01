Patient survey results are contained in the HCAHPS data tables. HCAHPS uses detailed
responses from patients on a variety of criteria to assign star ratings to hospitals.
Each hospital is assigned a star rating for each survey category (hospital cleanliness,
noise level, staff responsiveness, etc.) and for the hospital overall. To evaluate
whether patient responses are correlated with hospital procedure scores and variability,
it was necessary to combine transform procedure data with the summary star ratings
from the HCAHPS tables.
Using the data prepared for the hospital quality analysis, average procedure scores
and variability (standard deviation) were calculated for each hospital and joined
to the summary star ratings from the HCAHPS dataset. Because of the interest in
evaluating the potential for correlation between star ratings and both average scores
and variability, the overall hospital Quality Score computed for the hospital
analysis was not used.
Surprisingly, based on the output in the table below, there appears to be a slight
negative correlation between average procedure score and patient summary star rating.
Conversely, greater score variability appears positively correlated with patient
star ratings. However, both of these relationships are relatively weak and be caused
by number of unobserved variables. The questions asked by the HCAHPS survey cover
topics related to patient experience, which is relatively subjective; these experiential
topics are generally not covered by the procedure dataset, which is more focused
on appropriate treatment.
These factors lead me to conclude that no meaningful correlation exists between
patient survey responses and either average procedure scores or variability.
