To evaluate variability of procedures between hospitals, the average score for each
procedure across all hospitals and the standard deviation of the distribution of
scores were calculated. Unlike the calculations for hospital quality, records with
missing score data were excluded; as described in the hospital analysis methodology,
these records were only included to prevent distortion of summary scores for individual
hospitals. At the national level, there are enough records for each procedure that
excluding those with missing data will not skew the results - most procedures have
several thousand data points, and even the most poorly documented procedures have
over 100 records.

The table below presents the ten procedures with the highest standard deviation
among their reported scores. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability
among scores, while a lower standard deviation indicates more consistent scores.
As shown below, Thrombolytic Therapy and Fibrinolytic Therapy top the list of most
variable procedures.
